\textbf{RE: ILP Latex course}
\end{center}

I am writing regarding the ILP Latex course.  I attended the course on \today\ and found it very useful.  Unfortunately, I did not have time to attend the ``Beyond Basics'' course and would like to know if the course material is avaliable.

I realise that attendance at the course is vital to me understanding Latex, however I have lectures on all course dates.  If you could please forward me the course material, I am sure I can undertake the course in my own time.

On another note, writing letters, articles and books with latex is very easy.

\closing{Regards}
